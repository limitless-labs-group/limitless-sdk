## Installation

```bash
pip install limitless-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
import os
from limitless_sdk.api import HttpClient
from limitless_sdk.markets import MarketFetcher
from limitless_sdk.portfolio import PortfolioFetcher

async def main():
    # Setup - API key automatically loaded from LIMITLESS_API_KEY env variable
    http_client = HttpClient(base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange")

    try:
        # Get markets
        market_fetcher = MarketFetcher(http_client)
        markets = await market_fetcher.get_active_markets()
        print(f"Found {markets.total_markets_count} markets")

        # Fetch specific market (caches venue data for orders)
        market = await market_fetcher.get_market("bitcoin-2024")
        print(f"Market: {market.title}")

        # Get positions (requires authentication)
        portfolio_fetcher = PortfolioFetcher(http_client)
        positions = await portfolio_fetcher.get_positions()
        print(f"CLOB positions: {len(positions['clob'])}")

    finally:
        await http_client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Authentication

The SDK uses API keys for authentication. API keys can be obtained from your Limitless Exchange account settings.

### Basic Authentication

```python
import os
from limitless_sdk.api import HttpClient

# Option 1: Automatic from environment variable (recommended)
# Set LIMITLESS_API_KEY in your .env file or environment
http_client = HttpClient()

# Option 2: Explicit API key
http_client = HttpClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("LIMITLESS_API_KEY")
)

# Option 3: Custom base URL (for dev/staging)
http_client = HttpClient(
    base_url="https://staging.api.limitless.exchange",
    api_key="sk_test_..."
)

# All requests automatically include X-API-Key header
```

### Partner API Token v3 / HMAC Authentication

Use this flow when a partner first authenticates with a Privy identity token, derives a scoped API token, and then reuses the returned HMAC credentials for partner operations.

```python
import asyncio

from limitless_sdk import (
    Client,
    DeriveApiTokenInput,
    HMACCredentials,
    ScopeTrading,
    ScopeDelegatedSigning,
    ScopeAccountCreation,
    ScopeWithdrawal,
)


async def main():
    identity_token = "privy-identity-token"

    bootstrap = Client(base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange")
    capabilities = await bootstrap.api_tokens.get_capabilities(identity_token)
    print(capabilities.allowed_scopes)

    derived = await bootstrap.api_tokens.derive_token(
        identity_token,
        DeriveApiTokenInput(
            label="partner-bot",
            scopes=[
                ScopeTrading,
                ScopeDelegatedSigning,
                ScopeAccountCreation,
                ScopeWithdrawal,
            ],
        ),
    )

    scoped = Client(
        base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange",
        hmac_credentials=HMACCredentials(
            token_id=derived.token_id,
            secret=derived.secret,
        ),
    )

    tokens = await scoped.api_tokens.list_tokens()
    print(f"Active tokens: {len(tokens)}")

    await bootstrap.close()
    await scoped.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Partner surface added by this flow:
- `api_tokens.get_capabilities()`
- `api_tokens.derive_token()`
- `api_tokens.list_tokens()`
- `api_tokens.revoke_token()`
- `partner_accounts.create_account()`
- `partner_accounts.list_accounts()`
- `partner_accounts.check_allowances()`
- `partner_accounts.retry_allowances()`
- `partner_accounts.add_withdrawal_address()`
- `partner_accounts.delete_withdrawal_address()`
- `delegated_orders.create_order()`
- `delegated_orders.cancel_on_behalf_of()`
- `delegated_orders.cancel_all_on_behalf_of()`
- `server_wallets.redeem_positions()`
- `server_wallets.withdraw()`

Standard `X-API-Key` authentication remains fully supported for the existing portfolio, market, and regular order flows.

### Authenticated Profile Reads

Use `client.portfolio.get_current_profile()` to fetch the authenticated caller's private profile via `GET /profiles/me`. Use `get_profile(address)` when you need the existing address-based lookup via `GET /profiles/:account`.

```python
from limitless_sdk import Client

client = Client(api_key="sk_test_...")

current_profile = await client.portfolio.get_current_profile()
profile_by_address = await client.portfolio.get_profile(
    "0x1676716Ef7F19B5C5d690631CB57cf0bFD900A3d"
)

print(current_profile["id"])
await client.close()
```

Use partner HMAC credentials only in a backend or BFF service. Do not expose `token_id` / `secret` in browser bundles, frontend environment variables, or client-side storage.

Recommended setup:

- Keep public market and market-page reads in the browser.
- Store the real HMAC credentials on your backend.
- Use this SDK server-side to sign partner-authenticated requests.
- Expose only your own app-specific endpoints to the frontend.

#### Partner Account Listing

Use `client.partner_accounts.list_accounts()` from a backend or BFF with HMAC-scoped API-token credentials that include `account_creation`. This endpoint lists or recovers partner-owned child accounts created under the authenticated partner profile.

- `list_accounts()` calls `GET /profiles/partner-accounts`
- optional `account` filters by exact account address
- optional `limit` and `page` are positive integers; `limit` is capped to 25 before sending
- the SDK requires HMAC credentials and does not send `x-on-behalf-of`

```python
from limitless_sdk import ListPartnerAccountsParams

accounts = await client.partner_accounts.list_accounts(
    ListPartnerAccountsParams(
        account="0x1676716Ef7F19B5C5d690631CB57cf0bFD900A3d",
        limit=100,
        page=1,
    )
)

print(accounts.limit)  # 25
print(accounts.data[0].profile_id)
```

#### Partner Server-Wallet Allowances

Use `client.partner_accounts.check_allowances(profile_id)` and `client.partner_accounts.retry_allowances(profile_id)` only for partner child profiles created with `create_server_wallet=True`.

- `check_allowances()` calls `GET /profiles/partner-accounts/:profileId/allowances`
- `retry_allowances()` calls `POST /profiles/partner-accounts/:profileId/allowances/retry`
- both operations require HMAC-scoped API-token auth with `account_creation` and `delegated_signing` scopes
- `profile_id` should be the delegated child profile id

```python
import asyncio

from limitless_sdk import Client, HMACCredentials


async def main():
    client = Client(
        base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange",
        hmac_credentials=HMACCredentials(
            token_id="token-id",
            secret="token-secret",
        ),
    )

    try:
        allowances = await client.partner_accounts.check_allowances(352)
        if not allowances.ready:
            # Retry re-checks live chain state and submits only targets still missing.
            # A returned "submitted" status means this request submitted a sponsored tx/user operation.
            allowances = await client.partner_accounts.retry_allowances(352)

        print(allowances.ready)
    finally:
        await client.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Poll `check_allowances()` first. If `ready` is false and one or more targets are `missing` or `failed` with `retryable=True`, call `retry_allowances()`, then poll `check_allowances()` again after a short delay. Retry `429` responses raise `RateLimitError` and include `retryAfterSeconds` in `error.response_data`; retry `409` responses raise `ConflictError`, which means another retry is already running.

For a complete runnable flow, see [`examples/api_key_v3/partner_account_allowances.py`](https://github.com/limitless-labs-group/limitless-sdk/blob/main/examples/api_key_v3/partner_account_allowances.py).

#### Server Wallet Redeem & Withdraw

Use `client.server_wallets` only for server-managed wallets created in delegated-signing partner flows with `create_server_wallet=True`.

- `redeem_positions()` calls `POST /portfolio/redeem`
- `withdraw()` calls `POST /portfolio/withdraw`
- both operations require HMAC-scoped API-token auth
- `withdraw()` also requires the `withdrawal` scope
- set `on_behalf_of` to the delegated child profile id when withdrawing child server-wallet funds
- omit `on_behalf_of` only when withdrawing the authenticated caller's own server wallet to an explicit `destination`
- `amount` for withdraw must be provided in the token smallest unit
- omit `destination` to use the API default: authenticated partner smart wallet when present, otherwise authenticated partner account
- pass `destination` to withdraw directly to the authenticated partner account, authenticated partner smart wallet, or an active withdrawal address allowlisted on the authenticated partner profile
- `partner_accounts.add_withdrawal_address()` and `partner_accounts.delete_withdrawal_address()` manage the allowlist with Privy identity-token auth; API-token auth is not used for those allowlist endpoints
- in practice, redeem is most useful for an existing child profile that already traded in a now-resolved market

```python
import asyncio

from limitless_sdk import Client, HMACCredentials


async def main():
    client = Client(
        base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange",
        hmac_credentials=HMACCredentials(
            token_id="token-id",
            secret="token-secret",
        ),
    )

    try:
        redeem = await client.server_wallets.redeem_positions(
            condition_id="0x...",
            on_behalf_of=352,
        )

        withdraw = await client.server_wallets.withdraw(
            amount="5000000",
            on_behalf_of=352,
        )

        print(redeem.transaction_id, withdraw.transaction_id)
    finally:
        await client.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

To withdraw a partner child server wallet directly to a treasury address, allowlist the destination on the authenticated partner profile first. Use the same partner identity for the allowlist call and the same partner HMAC token for the withdraw call.

```python
from limitless_sdk import PartnerWithdrawalAddressInput

identity_token = "privy-identity-token"
treasury_address = "0x0F3262730c909408042F9Da345a916dc0e1F9787"

await client.partner_accounts.add_withdrawal_address(
    identity_token,
    PartnerWithdrawalAddressInput(address=treasury_address, label="treasury"),
)

treasury_withdraw = await client.server_wallets.withdraw(
    amount="5000000",
    on_behalf_of=352,
    destination=treasury_address,
)

own_wallet_withdraw = await client.server_wallets.withdraw(
    amount="5000000",
    destination=treasury_address,
)

await client.partner_accounts.delete_withdrawal_address(
    identity_token,
    treasury_address,
)
```

`redeem.hash` or `withdraw.hash` may be an empty string for user-operation submissions. Track those calls using `user_operation_hash` or `transaction_id`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Required for authenticated endpoints
LIMITLESS_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key_here

# Optional: Custom API URL (defaults to production)
# LIMITLESS_API_URL=https://api.limitless.exchange
```

### Custom HTTP Headers

You can configure custom headers globally (applied to ALL requests) or per-request:

```python
# Global headers (applied to all requests)
http_client = HttpClient(
    additional_headers={
        "X-Custom-Header": "value",
        "X-API-Version": "v1"
    }
)

# Per-request headers (request ID, tracing, etc.)
response = await http_client.get("/endpoint", headers={"X-Request-ID": "123"})
```

## Market Data

### Get Markets

```python
from limitless_sdk.markets import MarketFetcher

market_fetcher = MarketFetcher(http_client)

# Get active markets (paginated)
markets = await market_fetcher.get_active_markets({"page": 1, "limit": 50})
print(f"Total: {markets.total_markets_count}")
print(f"Markets: {len(markets.data)}")

# Get specific market (automatically caches venue data)
market = await market_fetcher.get_market("market-slug")
print(f"Title: {market.title}")
print(f"YES Token: {market.tokens.yes}")
print(f"NO Token: {market.tokens.no}")

# Venue data is now cached for efficient order creation
# Includes: exchange address (for signing) and adapter address (for NegRisk approvals)
```

## Market Pages & Navigation

```python
from limitless_sdk.api import HttpClient
from limitless_sdk.market_pages import MarketPageFetcher

http_client = HttpClient(base_url="https://api.limitless.exchange")
page_fetcher = MarketPageFetcher(http_client)

# 1) Navigation tree
navigation = await page_fetcher.get_navigation()

# 2) Resolve page by path (manual 301 handled internally)
page = await page_fetcher.get_market_page_by_path("/crypto")

# 3) Get markets with filters
markets = await page_fetcher.get_markets(
    page.id,
    {
        "limit": 20,
        "sort": "-updatedAt",
        "filters": {"ticker": ["btc", "eth"]},
    },
)

# 4) Property keys and options
property_keys = await page_fetcher.get_property_keys()
if property_keys:
    key = await page_fetcher.get_property_key(property_keys[0].id)
    options = await page_fetcher.get_property_options(key.id)
```

### Get Orderbook

```python
orderbook = await market_fetcher.get_orderbook("market-slug")

# Access bids/asks
for order in orderbook.get('orders', []):
    print(f"Price: {order['price']}, Size: {order['size']}")
```

## Token Approvals

**Important**: Before placing orders, you must approve tokens for the exchange contracts. This is a **one-time setup** per wallet.

### Required Approvals

**CLOB Markets:**

- **BUY orders**: Approve USDC → `market.venue.exchange`
- **SELL orders**: Approve Conditional Tokens → `market.venue.exchange`

**NegRisk Markets:**

- **BUY orders**: Approve USDC → `market.venue.exchange`
- **SELL orders**: Approve Conditional Tokens → **both** `market.venue.exchange` AND `market.venue.adapter`

### Quick Setup

Run the approval setup script:

```bash
# Configure your wallet in .env
python examples/00_setup_approvals.py
```

### Manual Approval Example

```python
from web3 import Web3
from eth_account import Account
from limitless_sdk.markets import MarketFetcher
from limitless_sdk.utils.constants import get_contract_address

# 1. Fetch market to get venue addresses
market = await market_fetcher.get_market('market-slug')

# 2. Initialize Web3 and wallet
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.base.org'))
account = Account.from_key(private_key)

# 3. Get contract addresses
usdc_address = get_contract_address("USDC", 8453)
ctf_address = get_contract_address("CTF", 8453)

# 4. Create contract instances
usdc = w3.eth.contract(address=usdc_address, abi=ERC20_APPROVE_ABI)
ctf = w3.eth.contract(address=ctf_address, abi=ERC1155_APPROVAL_ABI)

# 5. Approve USDC for BUY orders
max_uint256 = 2**256 - 1
tx = usdc.functions.approve(venue.exchange, max_uint256).build_transaction({...})
signed_tx = account.sign_transaction(tx)
w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_tx.raw_transaction)

# 6. Approve CT for SELL orders
tx = ctf.functions.setApprovalForAll(venue.exchange, True).build_transaction({...})
signed_tx = account.sign_transaction(tx)
w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_tx.raw_transaction)

# 7. For NegRisk SELL orders, also approve adapter
if market.neg_risk_request_id:
    tx = ctf.functions.setApprovalForAll(venue.adapter, True).build_transaction({...})
    signed_tx = account.sign_transaction(tx)
    w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_tx.raw_transaction)
```

For complete examples with proper ABIs and transaction handling, see [examples/00_setup_approvals.py](https://github.com/limitless-labs-group/limitless-sdk/blob/main/examples/00_setup_approvals.py).

## Order Management

The SDK supports three order types:

- **GTC (Good-Till-Cancelled)**: Uses `price` + `size` parameters
- **FAK (Fill-And-Kill)**: Uses `price` + `size` and cancels any unmatched remainder
- **FOK (Fill-Or-Kill)**: Uses `maker_amount` (total USDC to spend/receive)

### Create GTC Orders

```python
from limitless_sdk.orders import OrderClient
from limitless_sdk.types import Side, OrderType

# Setup order client (userData fetched automatically from profile)
order_client = OrderClient(
    http_client=http_client,
    wallet=account,
)

# Get token ID from market
token_id = str(market.tokens.yes)  # or market.tokens.no

# Create BUY GTC order
order = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=token_id,
    price=0.50,      # Minimum acceptable price
    size=5.0,        # Number of shares
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.GTC,
    market_slug=market.slug,
    post_only=True,  # Optional. Supported only for GTC orders
)

print(f"Order ID: {order.order.id}")
print(f"Status: {order.order.status}")
```

### Create FAK Orders

FAK (Fill-And-Kill) orders use the same `price`/`size` construction as `GTC`, but any unmatched remainder is cancelled immediately instead of resting on the orderbook.

```python
# FAK BUY order - fill up to 5 shares at the limit price, cancel remainder
order = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=token_id,
    price=0.45,
    size=5.0,
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.FAK,
    market_slug=market.slug
)

if order.maker_matches:
    print(f"Immediate matches: {len(order.maker_matches)}")
else:
    print("No immediate match. Remaining size was cancelled.")
```

### Create FOK Orders

FOK (Fill-Or-Kill) orders either execute immediately and completely or are cancelled. They use `maker_amount` instead of `price`/`size` parameters.

**Parameter Semantics**:

- **BUY orders**: `maker_amount` = total USDC to spend (e.g., 10.0 = $10 USDC)
- **SELL orders**: `maker_amount` = number of shares to sell (e.g., 18.64 shares)

```python
# FOK BUY order - spend $10 USDC
order = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=token_id,
    maker_amount=10.0,   # Spend $10 USDC
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.FOK,
    market_slug=market.slug
)

# FOK SELL order - sell 18.64 shares
order = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=token_id,
    maker_amount=18.64,  # Sell 18.64 shares
    side=Side.SELL,
    order_type=OrderType.FOK,
    market_slug=market.slug
)

# Check if filled
if order.maker_matches and len(order.maker_matches) > 0:
    print(f"FILLED: {len(order.maker_matches)} matches")
else:
    print("NOT FILLED (cancelled)")
```

### Cancel Orders

```python
# Cancel single order by ID
await order_client.cancel(order_id)

# Cancel all orders for a market
await order_client.cancel_all(market_slug)
```

### Cancel-Replace Orders

Atomically cancel a resting order and submit its replacement in a single request via `POST /orders/cancel-replace`. Identify the order to cancel with `order_id` or `client_order_id`, and set `mode` to `CancelReplaceMode.STOP_ON_FAILURE` (skip the replacement if the cancel fails) or `CancelReplaceMode.ALLOW_FAILURE`.

```python
from limitless_sdk import CancelReplaceMode, OrderType, Side

result = await order_client.cancel_replace(
    order_id="old-order-id",  # or client_order_id="..."
    mode=CancelReplaceMode.STOP_ON_FAILURE,
    token_id="123",
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.GTC,
    market_slug="market-slug",
    price=0.5,
    size=2,
)
# result.cancel and result.replacement each carry a per-leg status.
```

Replace many orders at once with `order_client.cancel_replace_batch(operations=[...])`, passing a list of dicts with the same keyword arguments; the response `results` are index-aligned to the input. Partner integrations use `delegated_orders.cancel_replace` / `cancel_replace_batch` (which accept `on_behalf_of`). The single-order variant accepts a `409` conflict as a returned result rather than raising.

## Partner AMM Trading

`client.partner_amm` trades binary AMM (FPMM) markets on behalf of a server wallet. Approvals are set up **once** per wallet/market pair; buy and sell never preflight allowances. All amounts are positive integer strings in the collateral token's base units (never floats). Authentication uses an HMAC API token (scopes `trading` + `delegated_signing`) or a per-call Privy `identity_token`; legacy API keys are rejected.

```python
from limitless_sdk import Client, AmmAllowanceParams, AmmBuyParams, AmmSellParams

client = Client(hmac_credentials={"token_id": TOKEN_ID, "secret": SECRET})

# 1. One-time approval setup for a wallet/market pair (BUY and SELL are independent).
#    ensure_allowance checks, approves at most once, then polls check until confirmed.
await client.partner_amm.ensure_allowance(
    AmmAllowanceParams(market="market-slug", side="BUY", on_behalf_of=12345)
)
await client.partner_amm.ensure_allowance(
    AmmAllowanceParams(market="market-slug", side="SELL", on_behalf_of=12345)
)

# 2. Buy: spend an exact collateral amount on outcome 0 (YES).
buy = await client.partner_amm.buy(
    AmmBuyParams(
        market="market-slug",
        outcome_index=0,               # 0 = YES, 1 = NO
        collateral_amount="1000000",   # base units, positive integer string
        slippage_bps=100,              # optional, 0..1000, defaults to 100
        idempotency_key="buy-unique-key-001",  # required; reuse exact key + body to retry safely
        on_behalf_of=12345,            # omit for a direct profile
    )
)
print(buy.status, buy.expected_shares, buy.min_shares)

# 3. Sell: request an exact collateral return.
sell = await client.partner_amm.sell(
    AmmSellParams(
        market="market-slug",
        outcome_index=0,
        collateral_return_amount="992015",
        idempotency_key="sell-unique-key-001",
        on_behalf_of=12345,
    )
)
print(sell.status, sell.expected_shares, sell.max_shares)
```

**Notes**:

- `ensure_allowance` polls `check_allowance` (default every 2s, up to 30 attempts; tune with `interval` / `max_attempts`). A `202 submitted` approve response is not confirmation.
- Reuse the same params on a timeout retry — the serialized body and `idempotency_key` stay byte-identical, so the server replays the original submission. Reusing a key with different params raises `ConflictError` (409).
- Errors map to typed classes: `ValidationError` (400), `AuthenticationError` (401/403), `ConflictError` (409), `UnprocessableEntityError` (422, e.g. insufficient balance/invalid quote), `TooEarlyError` (425, maintenance), `RateLimitError` (429), and `UpstreamUnavailableError` (502/503). The four AMM routes share a limit of 10 requests / 10s per actor.
- Pass `with_raw_response=True` to any AMM method to get an `HttpRawResponse` exposing the HTTP `status`, `headers`, and original `data`.

## Portfolio

### Get Positions

```python
from limitless_sdk.portfolio import PortfolioFetcher

portfolio_fetcher = PortfolioFetcher(http_client)

# Get authenticated profile
profile = await portfolio_fetcher.get_current_profile()
print(f"Profile ID: {profile['id']}")

# Get positions
positions = await portfolio_fetcher.get_positions()

# Access CLOB positions
clob_positions = positions['clob']
for position in clob_positions:
    print(f"Market: {position['market']['title']}")
    print(f"Size: {position['size']}")

# Access points
print(f"Points: {positions['accumulativePoints']}")
```

## WebSocket Support

Subscribe to backend-supported websocket events only. Public subscriptions include `subscribe_market_prices`, `subscribe_live_sports`, `subscribe_live_esports`, and `subscribe_market_lifecycle`; authenticated subscriptions include `subscribe_positions`, `subscribe_transactions`, and `subscribe_order_events`.

Connection headers (SDK tracking, `X-API-Key`, or the HMAC `lmts-*` set) are rebuilt before every connection attempt, so HMAC signatures stay within the server's timestamp window across automatic reconnects.

```python
from limitless_sdk.websocket import WebSocketClient, WebSocketConfig

# Setup WebSocket
config = WebSocketConfig(
    url="wss://ws.limitless.exchange",
    auto_reconnect=True,
    reconnect_delay=1.0
)
ws_client = WebSocketClient(config=config)

# Event handlers
@ws_client.on('connect')
async def on_connect():
    print("Connected")

@ws_client.on('orderbookUpdate')
async def on_orderbook_update(data):
    orderbook = data.get('orderbook', data)
    best_bid = orderbook['bids'][0]['price']
    best_ask = orderbook['asks'][0]['price']
    print(f"Bid: {best_bid:.4f} | Ask: {best_ask:.4f}")

@ws_client.on('newPriceData')
async def on_amm_price_update(data):
    for price in data.get('updatedPrices', []):
        print(f"AMM {price['marketAddress']}: YES={price['yesPrice']:.4f}")

@ws_client.on('orderEvent')
async def on_order_event(data):
    # Both frames arrive on `orderEvent`; discriminate on `source` + `type`.
    source, event_type = data.get('source'), data.get('type')

    if source == 'OME' and event_type == 'EXECUTION':
        # FAK/FOK terminal frame. eventId is "terminal:<orderId>".
        # price / remainingSize are JSON numbers (float).
        print(f"Execution {data['status']}: remaining {data['remainingSize']}")
    elif source == 'SETTLEMENT' and event_type == 'MATCHED':
        # Pre-settlement per-fill estimate (isEstimate == True).
        # Maker side reports fee 0; taker reports a real estimate.
        print(f"Matched {data['token']} @ {data['price']}")
    else:
        # Lifecycle frames: OME PLACEMENT/UPDATE/CANCELLATION, SETTLEMENT MINED/FAILED.
        print(f"Order event {source}/{event_type}")

# Connect and subscribe
await ws_client.connect()
await ws_client.subscribe('subscribe_market_prices', {'marketSlugs': [market_slug]})
```

Order events (`subscribe_order_events`) arrive on `orderEvent` and cover two
unions discriminated by `source` + `type`:

- **OME** frames carry `type` of `PLACEMENT`, `UPDATE`, `CANCELLATION`, or
  `EXECUTION` (the FAK/FOK terminal frame, which adds a `status` of `FILLED`,
  `PARTIALLY_FILLED`, or `KILLED`). `price` and `remainingSize` are JSON numbers.
- **SETTLEMENT** frames carry `type` of `MINED`, `FAILED`, or `MATCHED` (the
  pre-settlement per-fill estimate, with `isEstimate=True` and a `token` of
  `YES`/`NO`). On `MATCHED` the maker side reports a fee of 0; the taker reports
  a real estimate.

## Error Handling

The SDK provides `APIError` for all API-related errors:

```python
from limitless_sdk.api import APIError

try:
    order = await order_client.create_order(...)
except APIError as e:
    print(f"Status: {e.status_code}")
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Prints raw API response JSON
```

### Retry Mechanism

Use the `@retry_on_errors` decorator for custom retry logic:

```python
from limitless_sdk.api import retry_on_errors

@retry_on_errors(
    status_codes={500, 429},
    max_retries=3,
    delays=[1, 2, 3],
    on_retry=lambda attempt, error, delay: print(f"Retry {attempt+1}/3")
)
async def fetch_data():
    return await http_client.get("/endpoint")
```

### Logging

Enable debug logging to see request headers and details:

```python
from limitless_sdk.types import ConsoleLogger, LogLevel

logger = ConsoleLogger(level=LogLevel.DEBUG)
http_client = HttpClient(base_url="...", logger=logger)
```

## Architecture

The SDK is organized into modular components:

### Core Components

- **`HttpClient`**: Low-level HTTP client with API key authentication and retry logic
- **`OrderSigner`**: EIP-712 message signing for order creation
- **`RetryableClient`**: Auto-retry wrapper with configurable retry strategies

### Domain Components

- **`MarketFetcher`**: Market data retrieval (markets, orderbooks)
- **`OrderClient`**: Order creation/cancellation with automatic signing
- **`PortfolioFetcher`**: Portfolio and positions data
- **`WebSocketClient`**: Real-time CLOB orderbook, AMM/oracle price, position, transaction, order-event, and market lifecycle updates

### Type System

The SDK uses Pydantic models for type safety:

- **`UserProfile`**: User account information
- **`Side`**: `BUY` / `SELL` enum
- **`OrderType`**: `GTC` / `FAK` / `FOK` enum
- **`LogLevel`**: `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR` enum
- **`Market`**: Market metadata and configuration

## Key Features

### Venue Caching System

The SDK automatically caches venue data (exchange and adapter contract addresses) to optimize performance when creating multiple orders for the same market.

**How it works**:

```python
# Fetch market once
market_fetcher = MarketFetcher(http_client)
market = await market_fetcher.get_market("bitcoin-2024")

# Venue data is now cached automatically
# {
#   exchange: "0xa4409D988CA2218d956BeEFD3874100F444f0DC3",  # for order signing
#   adapter: "0x5a38afc17F7E97ad8d6C547ddb837E40B4aEDfC6"    # for NegRisk approvals
# }

# Create order client (userData fetched automatically from profile on first order)
order_client = OrderClient(http_client, wallet)

# Venue is fetched from cache (no API call)
# User data is fetched automatically on first order creation
order1 = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=str(market.tokens.yes),
    price=0.50,
    size=5.0,
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.GTC,
    market_slug=market.slug
)

# Still using cached venue data and user data
order2 = await order_client.create_order(
    token_id=str(market.tokens.no),
    price=0.30,
    size=10.0,
    side=Side.BUY,
    order_type=OrderType.GTC,
    market_slug=market.slug
)
```

**Performance benefits**:

- Eliminates redundant `/venues/:slug` API calls
- Faster order creation (cache hit vs network request)
- Reduced API rate limit usage

**Debug logging**: Enable debug mode to see venue cache operations:

```python
logger = ConsoleLogger(level=LogLevel.DEBUG)
http_client = HttpClient(base_url="...", logger=logger)

# You'll see:
# [Limitless SDK] Venue cached for order signing {
#   slug: 'bitcoin-2024',
#   exchange: '0xa4409D988CA2218d956BeEFD3874100F444f0DC3',
#   adapter: '0x5a38afc17F7E97ad8d6C547ddb837E40B4aEDfC6',
#   cacheSize: 1
# }
# [Limitless SDK] Venue cache hit { slug: 'bitcoin-2024', exchange: '0xa4...' }
```

### Token ID Extraction

CLOB markets use a tokens object for YES/NO positions:

```python
# Get YES token ID
token_id = str(market.tokens.yes)

# Get NO token ID
token_id = str(market.tokens.no)
```

### Raw API Responses

The SDK returns raw API responses without heavy parsing, allowing direct access to all fields:

```python
# Markets response
markets = await market_fetcher.get_markets()
total = markets['totalCount']
data = markets['data']

# Positions response
positions = await portfolio_fetcher.get_positions()
clob = positions['clob']
points = positions['accumulativePoints']
```

### Order Type Parameters

- **GTC orders**: Use `price` + `size` parameters

  ```python
  price=0.50,  # Minimum acceptable price (0-1 range)
  size=5.0     # Number of shares to buy/sell
  ```

- **FAK orders**: Use `price` + `size` parameters and cancel any unfilled remainder

  ```python
  price=0.45,  # Limit price
  size=5.0     # Shares to fill immediately if available
  ```

- **FOK orders**: Use `maker_amount` parameter (semantics differ by side)

  ```python
  # BUY: Total USDC to spend
  maker_amount=10.0  # Spend $10 USDC to buy shares

  # SELL: Number of shares to sell
  maker_amount=18.64 # Sell 18.64 shares for USDC
  ```

## Changelog

### v1.1.0

**Release Date**: June 8, 2026

Adds the OME `EXECUTION` (FAK/FOK terminal) and Settlement `MATCHED` (pre-settlement per-fill) WebSocket frames, and corrects the OME numeric field types.

#### Highlights

- **OME `EXECUTION` frame**: `orderEvent` now models the FAK/FOK terminal frame with `type="EXECUTION"`, a `status` of `FILLED`/`PARTIALLY_FILLED`/`KILLED`, and a string `eventId` of `"terminal:<orderId>"`.
- **Settlement `MATCHED` frame**: `orderEvent` now models the pre-settlement per-fill estimate with `type="MATCHED"`, `isEstimate`, and `token` (`YES`/`NO`).
- **Type fix (breaking, type-only)**: OME `price`/`remainingSize` are now `float` and `eventId` is `int | str`. Runtime values never changed — OME frames always emitted these as JSON numbers; only the static types were wrong.

### v1.0.11

**Release Date**: May 27, 2026

Latest release with authenticated profile reads, partner sub-account listing/recovery, and WebSocket subscription validation cleanup.

#### Highlights

- **Authenticated Profiles**: Fetch the current authenticated profile with `GET /profiles/me`.
- **Partner Account Listing**: `partner_accounts.list_accounts()` lists partner-owned sub-accounts with optional address recovery and pagination.
- **WebSocket Channel Validation**: Unsupported legacy short channel literals now fail fast.

### v1.0.10

**Release Date**: May 12, 2026

Latest release with authenticated WebSocket HMAC fixes for Python Socket.IO clients.

#### Highlights

- **WebSocket HMAC Auth**: Authenticated subscriptions now sign the Engine.IO WebSocket path emitted by `python-engineio` and use a stable WebSocket upgrade URL.

### v1.0.9

**Release Date**: May 4, 2026

Release with partner withdrawal-address allowlist helpers, server-wallet withdrawals to explicit whitelisted treasury destinations, and expanded WebSocket event coverage.

#### Highlights

- **Partner Withdrawal Allowlists**: `partner_accounts.add_withdrawal_address()` and `delete_withdrawal_address()` use Privy identity auth for `/portfolio/withdrawal-addresses`.
- **Treasury Withdrawals**: `server_wallets.withdraw()` supports child server-wallet withdrawals to allowlisted destinations and caller-wallet withdrawals with `destination` only.
- **Expanded WebSocket Surface**: Added typed subscription/event coverage for order events, live sports/esports, market lifecycle, oracle price data, and system messages.
